# ðŸ§¾ Fake Banknote Detection using Decision Tree Classifier

This project implements a **Decision Tree Classifier from scratch** in Python to **detect fake vs genuine banknotes** using features extracted from banknote images.

The features in the dataset were obtained by applying **wavelet transform** on scanned images of banknotes, capturing various statistical properties. The goal is to accurately classify whether a banknote is authentic (`1`) or counterfeit (`0`) based on these features.

---

**Problem Statement**: Build a decision tree classifier to distinguish between real and fake banknotes.

**Dataset Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Banknote Authentication Dataset

**Features**:

- `variance`: Wavelet transformed image (continuous)
- `skewness`: of the image
- `kurtosis`: of the image
- `entropy`: of the image

**Label**:

- `0` â€“ Counterfeit
- `1` â€“ Genuine

### ðŸ”§ Features Implemented

- Custom Decision Tree Classifier (built from scratch)
- Gini Index as the splitting criterion
- Tree building with configurable max depth and min samples per node
- Tree traversal for predictions
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
- Feature importance analysis
- Pretty-printed tree structure in the console

### ðŸ§ª Methodology

- Load and preprocess the dataset (`data_banknote_authentication.csv`).
- Split into training (70%) and testing (30%).
- Build the tree using Gini Index as the impurity measure.
- Stop tree growth using parameters like max depth and min elements per node.
- Predict on both training and testing datasets.
- Evaluate using accuracy and scikit-learn metrics.
- Print feature importance and tree structure.

### ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-banknote-detection.git
cd fake-banknote-detection
```

2. Run the Jupyter notebook `Banknote_DecisionTree.ipynb` in your preferred environment (Jupyter/Colab).
